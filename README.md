# AE-160-Lab-1
For this lab, data from each .csv file in the /Data folder is imported as a pandas dataframe and separated by each column, i.e. dynamic pressure, normal force, etc. The data is also converted from imperial to metric and sorted into graphs based on what we want to see.

Important list indices for data reading functions:
<ul>
    <li>0: Flat Plate Angle
    <li>1: Flat Plate Velocity
    <li>2: Half Sphere
    <li>3: Inverted Cup
    <li>4: Sphere
</ul>
